**IntroLink Prototype:**

The concept behind Introlink is simple: provide an interactive platform where users can connect with like-minded people from their schools or universities, at their own pace.

The app is built using Swift UI in Apple Xcode.

*Key features:*
1. Signing up on Introlink is fast and simple. Users can register simply by entering their name, age, school name, and gender.

2. Once registered, users are presented with a wide range of interest options, like music, research, sports, and more.

3. For instance, if someone selects music as an interest, they’ll be matched with others in their area who also love music. 
   This fosters a sense of local community, helping users gradually build friendships while still feeling comfortable.
   
4. What Sets Introlink Apart is the custom AI designed specifically for assisting shy individuals in initiating conversations. 
   Introlink uses Machine Learning to generate personalized, friendly conversation starters based on shared interests. Let’s assume I’m an introvert. 
   The app matches me with Christina, another socially introverted individual. The AI then crafts a personalized message to start the conversation,
   relieving me of the pressure to make the first move. Now, I can simply respond with a friendly ‘hi!’ On her end,
   Christina receives my message and no longer feels the burden of initiating the conversation.
   This approach breaks the ice naturally, without either user needing to take the first step.

**PS:** The IntroLink Prototype Code is intended solely for demonstration purposes and does not incorporate the custom machine learning models for initiating assistive conservation.
